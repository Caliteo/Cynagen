## Redstone Related:
> Hoppers are 3 times slower than vanilla. This is to reduce the ticks needed by hoppers.

> Redstone, repeaters, comparators will be automatically destroyed if the server detects a dense redstone activity in an area. 
Hoppers, observers, noteblocks, and etc will contribute to the density.

> Server uses a different more optimized algorithm than vanilla. The only affects redstone dust. The behavior of redstone dust
**should** be identical to vanilla behavior.

> The server performance also reflects how redstone performs. If the server TPS is low, redstone will also be slower.

> Mob tracking distance are reduced.

> Mobs per chunk are limited.
