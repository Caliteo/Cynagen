"Microtown was founded by microbrains with a population of 3.  The town quickly expanded to around seven people, much to the surprise of its founder, but several of the people who came left soon after, not to be seen on the server since. The town now has a population of 14 people. On July 29, 2019, the town was griefed twice by a new player who was invited to the town, when all the food at the public farm was stolen, the tilled land broken, and water sources stopped. Great amounts of cobblestone were also placed on almost all unclaimed land within the town center, but it wasn't that serious and the player was banned."
