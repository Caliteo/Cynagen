Anyone can contribute to the history archives. 

When you add sections to the History, please use this format: (mm/dd/yyy).

Example: June 4, 1776  /   September 9, 2001

## Regulations. (Subject to change)
a). It most be at least somewhat interesting.

b). Your contribution has to at least have decent grammar and writing skills.

c). When you contribute to the archive, make sure to add your IGN at the end of the post. Example: [Here]


If your contribution is very long (>3 setences) and would like to elaborate more, you'll need to put on somewhere else (i.e. Google Docs, Pastebin, Hastebin). On the original master post, put "[Here]" and link it to the elaborated content.

To make this process easier, you can upload it to any website where you can host your text (i.e. Google Docs). Before your submission to the history of the archive goes public, I'll make another file on the archive containing your elaborated post. I'll then link everything together.
