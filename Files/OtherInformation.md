### Mob Cap

There is a mobcap on the server. This mob cap is per-chunk based. That means if you have hit a maximum number of mobs allowed in the current chunk, you can always go to another chunk and get more mobs.

There is also a maximum amount for each individual mobs. For example, in a single chunk, you may ONLY have up to a maximum of 10 turtles. The amount for each individual mobs are different.

At the current time, name-tagged mobs won't despawn when the mob limit is reached. 



### Claims

It is your responsibility to claim your land. Staff is able to roll back griefs, although it doesn't completely recover everything. 

Claims do not expire. However; they will be removed by staff depending on the circumstances.

Claimed animals such as Parrots and Wolves can still be damaged even if they are in a claim. Suggest that you put them in your house.

Item frames can also be punched off. If you are worried about it being stolen, cover it up or make sure there's no way for a person to reach that area. 

It's important when claiming that you don't overlap claim. It can be tricky to see where they are, but if you hold a stick + shift + right click and it'll show you claims around you. Remember that your chest, when placed, also automatically creates a claim around it. Check if that's the case before freaking out.

You need to claim at least 50 blocks from another person's build. If the person you're claiming next to doesn't care, then it's good. If they want it to be removed, then you'll need to relocate.

Backups of the world are done every day and go back up to a month. If you need a build recovered from longer than that period, you are essentially screwed. 



### Ignoring players

Sometimes players can be very annoying. You can easily ignore them by typing /ignore (username) and they will be ignored. 

You can view the list of everyone you've ignored via /ignorelist.



### VIP Perks

The perks of VIP can be found [HERE](https://cynagen.craftingstore.net/category/22212)


### Sethomes

You are only about to set 3 homes as a default player and 4 homes if you're a VIP.

For those of you who have more than the limit, you'll still be able to use them. However, you won't be able to set any more homes until and delete homes and go under the limit.



### Server Specs

That is classified information ;)

If you want to see if the server is lagging or your ping, you can press Tab. Your ping and the server TPS will be shown in TABS.



### Can't get up into the nether roof

That is on purpose. This is to prevent people from generating mass amounts of chunks in the nether, be lazy and build gold farms there, make travel too easy, and few other stuff.

Don't bother debating to staff or an administrator about it, you'll be ignored. The nether roof will stay off limits.



### Why are some particles not showing?

Some people have low-end computers that can easily lag because of the large amounts of particles. By default, the server lowers and/or disable some particles. If you want to enable them, simply do /toggle and enable particles.

There's also some additional things you can toggle off / on.



### Automatic deletion of chunks

Chunks that haven't been visited in a while that are not claimed will be deleted after X amount of time. This is also why it's very important to claim your house so that the server doesn't just delete it.

This is also one of the reasons that the server is able to have 1.13 chunks without you having to go out very far into the world.

Stuff deleted by the server can be recovered providing that the server has a backup of it. Keep in mind that recovering builds like this will take some time and will easily piss off Kyrobi if done too frequently.

Backups of the world are done every day and go back up to a month. If you need a build recovered from longer than that period, you are essentially screwed.



### Additional server info

There is a way to check for additional information on the server such as the average play time of players. 

You can access it [HERE](http://cynagen.xyz:8144/server). The page might take some time to update. 



### Increase player slots

Most likely not. This is a small server and a small community, there is no reason to increase it further. If anything, the player slot might decrease in the future. 

If the server is full, consider buying VIP to join even when the server is full. You'll also support the server along the way.



### Achievements disabled

Yes, they are. No one really cares about them and it's a pain moving thousands of useless files when the time comes.
