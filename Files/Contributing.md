At the moment in time, you can only contribute to the wiki. This is how you contribute:

1. On the main page, go into the **Files**. In here, it contains all the docs for the Wiki. 

2. Click on the file that you would like to propose a change to (contribute).  

3. Near the right side of the document, there is a pencil icon (Fork this project and edit it). Click on it. This essentially makes a copy of the file that YOU own. After you edit it, you can send the edited file back to me. I can then review the changes and apply them.

3(1). You may reformat the document if you like (i.e. bold some stuff, link some stuff, etc), add new information, or just update the outdated information. 

4. After you finished editing the document, click **Propose File change** > **Create Pull Request** and then **Create Pull Request** again. 

5. Done! Your edits are now sent in for review. 


If the main branch (This one) gets edited, a pull request will show up on YOUR copy of the files. Simply accept the merge so that it has the up-to-date files as the main one.
