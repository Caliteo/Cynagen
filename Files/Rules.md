## 1. Do not grief.

**a).** Do not grief someone’s build. This includes any block, farm animals, captured mobs, and villagers.

**b).** Unless given explicit permission from a staff or the owner of the build, destroying anything placed by hand is considered griefing.

**c).** Griefing what is considered an abandoned build is generally not allowed. If a staff later finds out you griefed, you’ll still be punished.

**d).** If a person requests for you to leave their claim for any reason, you must comply with their request. Not leaving will result in you being teleported away. If you return to the claim without permission from the person, you will be punished.

**e).** If you live inside a person's claim, the owner of the claim has the final say. This includes kicking you out without notice, telling you where to build, and etc. Land claim owner's actions cannot supersede the server's rule: destroying your build, killing your animals, and etc. 

**f).** Taking another player's item(s) without their consent is considered griefing. 



## 2. Do not advertise.
**a).** Advertising is prohibited in chat. Advertising consists of **promoting** anything that isn’t Cynagen related.

**b).** Discussion of external products (Computers, Hypixel, Bell Peppers, Dr. Pepper, etc.) are allowed as long as they are not being promoted. YouTube videos, Google links, Twitch, and external sites are allowed provided you're sensible with them - no linking to a virus, NSFW, or the like.

**c).** If you advertise on the server, you will be punished depending on the severity and frequency of the advertisement.

**d).** Advertising your in-game products is fine; you are allowed to promote your plot shop and products you are selling in-game as long as it isn’t excessive (excessive being a period of time where you think won't annoy players on the server).



## 3. Be Respectful to everyone. 
**a).** You are allowed to swear on this server, but you may not direct your language toward another user with intent to be harmful. Staff will decide if the language is used to harm others. If you'd like to debate your case, you will need to provide evidence that you’re not violating the rule.

**b).** Demeaning rhetorics are not allowed anywhere on the server (builds, chat, books, signs, etc).

**c).** Cyber-bullying, harassment, and doing things to create chaos isn’t allowed.

**d).** If a player is being inappropriate in chat, contact the staff about it. You can use the /ignore command to ignore them. If you engage in a conflict with them, you will also be punished.



## 4. Keep the server peaceful and enjoyable.
**a).** Keep controversial topics such as political or religious related issues out of the server.

**b).** Inappropriate skins are not allowed on the server. You will be reqested to change your skin. Failure to change your skin will result in a ban.

**c).** Inappropriate usernames are not allowed on the server. You will be requested to make a name change. Failure to change your name will result in a ban.

**d).** Purposely causing lag to the server is not allowed. This includes anything that will jeopardize the server's integrity.

**e).** Any build(s) that pose as hate crime, inciting hate, religious matters, political matters, and etc are not allowed.

**f).** Structures like penises and middle fingers are allowed, but there are limitations. This is an out of sight, out of mind type of deal. If you don't want to be punished for it, put it somewhere where other people won't easily see it. This includes building it underground in a claim you own, inside of your house, or in an remote location where no one will see (as long as it's on claimed land that you actively use). Building it next to someone's house, outside of spawn, and randomly across the server is not allowed.

**g).** Anyone with bad faith and/or deliberarely irritates and harasses other player(s) within the game are not permitted on the server.



## 5. Cheating, hacking, and exploiting are not allowed. 
**a).** If you abuse any exploits, bugs, or glitches, you will be punished based on the severity of the abuse. Unfair advantages that you find are considered exploits and should be reported to a staff member or in the #support channel on Discord. 

**b).** If you have any knowledge of advantageous bugs, glitches, or exploits, please report them immediately. Failure to do so will result in both parties being banned.

**c).** Using modifications to the game such as x-ray texture packs are also considered cheating.

**d).** Using aspects of the game in unintended ways are prohibited. If you're not sure, ask in our Discord.

**e).** Using anything that gives the user a clear advantage on the server. If you're not sure, ask in our Discord.



## 6. Use some common sense.
