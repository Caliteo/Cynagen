### Febuarary 2018
Many people were dissapointed in the fact that the server was shutting down. However, I decided to give the server to a person named Fixerboy and let him host the server. For things did not turn out well. First, he had a different idea on how the server will move forward. Due to this, many people that went to the server hosted by Fixerboy were not happy. To protest, the Cynagen members decided to build lag machines, trolling, and griefing to get the point across.

Things were looking tense.
