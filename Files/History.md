# The War II
### April, 2018
A major Cynagen player, GamerFishy, eventually gained Moderator status on Fixerboy's version of Cynagen. GamerFishy wanted to be a Moderator on the actual Cynagen when it was still up. Now that she's a Moderator, she dedcided to stay on Fixerboy's server. The rest of the Cynagen members saw this as a betrayal. The fact that she abandoned all of the other players just so she could be a staff on the other Cynagen.

Due to this, members of Cynagen decided to go on Fixerboy's server and cause mayhem. Weeks later, GamerFishy officially hates all the Cynagen member, include the server in it's entirety. She thinks that the server is racist, homophobic, and ablist. In retaliation, the members of Cynagen also began to despise her more.


# The Secret Month
### Last few days of March, 2018
I decided that it's time to bring the server back again. The Cynagen that Fixerboy owned didn't end well and the friends that were on the private server are no longer active. This is an attempt to bring back everything that was lost.

### Late to mid March, 2018
The twenty or so players that were invited onto the private server became less and less active. It came to a point where no one would be online anymore.

### March 1, 2018
Due to the original Cynagen shutting down, I decided to make a private server to have a select few on Cynagen to play on it. It was just a small vanilla server with custom terrain generation.

### Febuarary 2018
Many people were dissapointed in the fact that the server was shutting down. However, I decided to give the server to a person named Fixerboy and let him host the server. For things did not turn out well. First, he had a different idea on how the server will move forward. Due to this, many people that went to the server hosted by Fixerboy were not happy. To protest, the Cynagen members decided to build lag machines, trolling, and griefing to get the point across.

Things were looking tense.

### Febuarary 22, 2018
Nearing the final day until the server shuts down. Due to the insane amount of stress that I wasn't expecting when going into this, I decided to shut down the server when the month is over.

# The Beginning

### June 4, 2017
The server has officially been made open to the public, anyone can join the server. This was also near the time when I was inspired and motivated by other server owners and wanted to make my own. 

### March 17, 2015
The server was officially created. Was created so that my school friends could join and have fun.
