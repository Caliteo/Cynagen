This folder contains the server settings and plugin settings for the server. I will try my best to keep everything here up-to-date and have it synced with the actual server.

Everything posted here is up to my descretion. Not everything will be public. Example of such things would be special anticheat settings,
passwords, seeds, player's private save data, and the likes. This is so that security won't be jeopodized - to an extent anyways.

Why am I making most of the settings public? It's so that techinical players can dive in and see how things work on the server.
It also further broadends the information avaiable on the server for players to access. Having more information on how the server works would benefit every player.

If you would like to add, remove, or change some configs in ways you think will benefit the server, feel free to make a pull request.














inb4 Aznation (or other servers) uses this info for their own benefits.
