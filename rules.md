## 1. Do not grief.

* Do not grief someone’s build. This includes any block, farm animals, captured mobs, and villagers.

* Unless given explicit permission from a staff or the owner of the build, destroying anything placed by hand is considered griefing.

* Griefing what is considered an abandoned build is generally not allowed either. If you can get away with it, then consider yourself lucky. If a staff later down the road finds out you griefed, you’ll still be punished.

* If a person trusts you onto their land and you griefed from it, you will be punished.

* If a person is helping you and takes stuff from you by “accident”, they’ll have 2 days to restore the items before they are punished.

* If a person requests for you to leave their claim for any reason, you must comply with their request. Not leaving will result in you being teleported away, and if you return to the claim without permission from the person you will be punished.

* Purposely claiming land / building right next to an existing claim/build is not permitted.

* Placing blocks to purposely harm another player’s build it also considered griefing.

## 3. Be Respectful to everyone. 
* You are allowed to swear on this server, but you may not direct your language toward another user with intent to be harmful. Staff will decide if the language is used to harm others. If you'd like to debate your case, you will need to provide evidence that you’re not violating the rule.

* Racist rhetorics are not allowed anywhere on the server (includes chat, books, signs, etc.).

* Cyber-bullying, harassment, and doing things to create chaos isn’t allowed.

* If you find someone that has any sort of machine or knowledge of any bugs/duplication glitches, please report them immediately. Failure to do so will result in both parties being banned.
