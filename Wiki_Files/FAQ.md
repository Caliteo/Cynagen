### How do I apply for staff?

### I died in the end, can I get my stuff back?

> No, regardless if it's caused by a glitch or the anti-cheat. It is advised that you stash all your valuables away before you visit the end. If you are in the end raiding end cities, make sure you're constantly putting all your valuables in an ender chest. 

Best course of action if you're falling into the void, instantly log out and tell a staff the situation. Don't log back in until you're told to.

### Can I claim an unclaimed build?

> Case 1: If a person's land expires due to them being inactive, then the building that was protected is fair game. Anyone can destroy it if they wish / claim it as their own.

If they fail to reclaim in within 5 days, then it's also fair game.(You'll need an alternative way for staff to prove that this build / claim if yours or else the 5 days won't apply.)
