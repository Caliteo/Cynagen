# Background

Back around Febuarary 13, 2020, players named SoftballGenius3 "Soft" and BountySlayer_24 "Bounty" decided to create their own server with SoftballGenius has the owner. Soft was clearly inspired by Cynagen. While building up her server, she has essentially copied what makes Cynagen unique. The following contiains screenshot evidence of this offense.



**Plugins**

Architech has many of the plugins that Cynagen has. It's one thing to have some of the same plugin, but Soft has come on Cynagen multiple times to view the plugins list (which is public).

The server logs when someone does `/plugins` or `/pl` along with if someone has obtained a VIP Shard. This screenshot shows the amount of times she's looked at the plugins page.

I know that this section is relatively petty, but it's still important to point out as she gets mostly everything from Cynagen.
